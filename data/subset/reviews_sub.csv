Very close to the Thames were there are a few very nice pubs, also just a short walk to Hammersmith. Very happy with our stay would diffently stay again"

Fantastic host in a superb location right on Thames Walk near Hammersmith bridge with great looking pubs on the waterfront for socialising under the stars.
The room I stayed in now has two beds so is ideal for a small family that want to share a room together.
The bathroom is close by but not connected so no excessive noise - in fact I hardly heard the other guests staying in other rooms and only bumped into them in the well equipped kitchen, which contains an AlkaWay water ioniser.
This is superb because it makes the tap water drinkable and great for your health and also you can avoid carting plastic bottles of water from the shops.

There are local shops for essentials and restaurants/takeaways within easy walking distance.
If you are a veggie or just fancy a change then you have to visit 222VV for a superb lunch buffet or evening meal - (URL HIDDEN)
I walked there with two bags over my shoulders as it is not too far along the Thames Path then up to north end road.
An easy walk if you're fit and the weather is good.

Juri is a great host and I could have easily stayed on for hours chatting away about life, business, health, fitness, etc, but unfortunately I had to get moving to attend an Expo at Olympia.
When chatting with an exhibitor I heard her story about a terrible night sleep in a Novotel with noisy guests and doors slamming shut at all times of the night - I felt a bit guilty telling her I slept right through from 9.30pm - 7am - woke up and made myself a healthy breakfast before going for a morning walk beside the Thames.

There are parks both East and West so great for picnics or outdoor yoga/exercise or meditation sessions.

And the house is very spacious, with modern furnishings in a beautiful leafy part of Hammersmith, and only a stones throw away from the waterfront and a nearby park. I shared the house with several travelling Europeans, so lots of interesting conversations and a lively, diverse atmosphere. Would stay again. :)"

Juri was incredibly friendly and helpful.
We had a very easy and pleasant stay."

Nuff said."

Price was excellent, would certainly stay there again - can certainly recommend it to others. Definite thumbs up!"
2656834,12344746,2014-04-29,13754487,Marie,"My friends and I didn't meet Juri until the morning of our departure. We stayed there for 2 nights but were barely home! The instructions he provided to his place was a little vague so (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) map directions from wherever you're coming from. The house was gorgeous and the room we stayed in at the top of the first flight of stairs was perfect for 3 of us. The bathroom was very spacious, but the knobs in the shower were coming off so you'd have to be really careful adjusting the knobs. We were very comfortable and in awe with the aesthetics of the house. We had met other guests of the house who were very friendly. Although we were not in the house 80% of the time it was really lovely to come back to a well-kept house after a long day."

2656834,12889148,2014-05-13,13657624,Alain,"Notre sejour chez Juri a été formidable! Toute les informations qu'il a donné  à l'avance sont exactes. Il repond toujours au message. Si vous recherchez un bel appartement près du centre de Londres je vous conseille Juri. Il est tres sympatique et ne vous derange pas du tout. Sa maison dispose d'une belle cuisine moderne ou vous avez votre compartiment dans le frigerateur et dans le placard et petit déjeuner offert :) . Le salon, les chambres et la salle de bain sont magnifiques et spacieuses (serviette fourni), salle de bain commune. On s' est senti comme dans un hôtel.  La maison est située pas trop loin de plusieurs métro et de stations de bus. Derrière la maison une riviere avec des jardins où l'on peut se promener s' il fait beau.  A proximité il y a des commerces pour se nourrir. Notre sejour fut un régale.  Merci Juri de ton acceuil."
2656834,12939421,2014-05-14,305583,Rósa,Juri´s place is amazing I wish it would have been more than just one night.  The downstairs chill area is very good and he has every little thing thoughtfully arranged.  The decor is qute friendly and our beds had about 4 pillows in each. Nest time I´m in London I hope to stay there again.
2656834,12987919,2014-05-16,15227591,Chris,"Excellent host, lovely house and a very comfortable room. The bathroom is shared but it was always available whenever I needed it plus it was always clean and tidy. All in all it was a very efficient and pleasant stay. The weather too was beautiful so the riverside location was a major bonus.   "
2656834,13141954,2014-05-20,13307728,Joan,My stay at the Terraceside is all good! Very clean and quite efficient! Everything as expected! We get privacy we needed and everythig quite convenient!
